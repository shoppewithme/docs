# Introduction

Welcome to the Shoppe API! You can use our API to access Shoppe API endpoints, which can get information on various users, items, orders, and sales in our database.

We have language bindings in HTTP! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

<aside class="notice">
All requests to the api should be made to <code>https://api.shoppewith.me/1.1/[api_endpoint]</code>
